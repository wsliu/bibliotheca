Need to improve:
----------------------

1. the index used in setting reserved_state of book and setting input of reserve_Book are different. It is misleading.
(in test methods : "shouldReturnThanksReservedBooksSuccessfully" & "shouldReturnSorryReservedBooksUnsuccessfully")

2 the process for "menu" and "books"
    It should be encapsulated better. The "size()" of them are exposed in test.
    the initialization of them is not good.

Puzzles:
------------------------

1. How to write the test for main?
1. How to give methods good names?
1. How to refactor the methods:"selectMenuOptions" & "reserveBook"?
